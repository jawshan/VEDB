Goal#1
Finding the Max FFT window of head shake and nod

Ind_visualization_angular_vel.py for checking individual sessions data

#Step1: Use angular_vel_normalized_resampled_090525.py to get the angular velocity and time stamp Excel files

#Step 2: Use xl2_fft_090525.py to get the max FFT window of head shake and nod. This code takes the angular velocity and timestamp Excel workbooks as input and runs sliding window FFT to find the time window of the max headshake/nod.

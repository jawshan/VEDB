Goal#1
Finding the first-time window of head shake and nod

#Step1: Use angular_vel.py to get the angular velocity and time stamp Excel files

#Step 2: Use MaxAndFirstShake_sliding_fft.py to get the first-time window of head shake and nod. This code takes the angular velocity and timestamp Excel workbooks as input and runs sliding window FFT to find the time window of the first headshake/nod.
